Added a feature to delete places from a trip.
In server/routes.js, a new route was added to handle the request to delete places from a trip. The request is handled by a new controller function that deletes the places from the associated trip and returns a response to the client. This feature allows users to remove places they no longer want on their trip, providing more flexibility and control over their itinerary.

Changed Map component to zoom in on click
In client/src/components/Map.js, the Map component was modified to zoom in when clicked. This change was made to improve user experience by making it easier to explore the map. The previous behavior required the user to manually adjust the zoom level, which could be time-consuming and frustrating. With the new behavior, the map will automatically zoom in when the user clicks anywhere on it, allowing them to quickly focus on areas of interest.

Removed client-side JavaScript files from public directory.
The public directory, which is served directly to clients, previously contained several client-side JavaScript files. These files, likely generated during a build process, were no longer needed and have been removed to reduce the size of the directory and the amount of data that needs to be transferred to clients. This change should not impact users directly, but may result in slightly faster page load times.

Fixed routing issue and updated various components and index files.
The commit includes modifications to several components (LoginForm, NavBar, and SignUpForm) and the index files (client and server). The routing issue was resolved, which might have resulted in broken links or incorrect navigation for users. Additionally, there were updates to the public folder on the server side, which could impact the loading of the application's main bundle. Overall, these changes should improve the user experience by ensuring proper navigation and loading of the application.

Packaged client and server together
Combined the client-side and server-side code into a single deployment unit. This was done to simplify the deployment process and make it easier to manage the application as a whole. The client-side components were moved from the server to the client, and the server was updated to only handle API requests. The client now fetches data from the server using the fetch API and renders the components accordingly. This change does not impact the user experience directly but might lead to faster deployments and easier maintenance.
